## [SurrounDead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1645820/SurrounDead/) Save Manager

## How to use
1. Download the latest version in [releases](https://github.com/vulcan-dev/SDSaves/releases)
2. Run the program
3. To create a new save, type a name in the `Input Box` and click `Add`. This will copy your save to the `Saves` folder. (Note: You can overwrite a save if you use the same name)

## Issues:
- If you load two saves and spawn in, your player position will be in place of the other save. To fix this, just relaunch the game. As of `v1.1.0f`, it keeps some save data in memory and it doesn't get cleared when you go to the menu.

Before you use this, just make a backup just in case anything goes wrong. I don't see it happening but it's not impossible.
