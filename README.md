## SurrounDead Save Manager

## How to use
1. Download the latest version in [releases](https://github.com/vulcan-dev/SDSaves/releases)
2. Run the program
3. To create a new save, type a name in the `Input Box` and click `Add`. This will copy your save to the `Saves` folder. (Note: You can overwrite a save if you use the same name)

## Issues:
- If you load two saves and spawn in, your player position will be in place of the other save. A potential fix is to fully restart the game. I'll speak to Zur about it tomorrow, seems to be a game bug.
- Sort of an issue: Don't put a newline in the `Input Box`, I had to make it multiline so I could increase the height. Windows Forms is garbage.

Before you use this, just make a backup just in case anything goes wrong. I don't see it happening but it's not impossible.
